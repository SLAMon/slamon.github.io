## What is SLAMon?
SLAMon is Service Level Agreement Monitor: A tool for monitoring live business
processes and their live performance as seen by the customer using the business
process.

SLAMon gathers performance data from the whole business process instead
of separate tasks inside the process.  The business process owner defines the
business process test flow and the data gathered from the flow, so that the data
can be aggregated to usable statistics.

SLAMon can be used for example testing whether a cloud service's process time
meets the service level agreement, or whether a given business process in
a cloud works as it is defined to work.
