{"name":"SLAMon","tagline":"Service Level Agreement Monitoring","body":"### What is SLAMon\r\n\r\nService Level Agreement Monitoring (SLAMon) is a tool for monitoring live business processes and their live performance as seen by the customer using the business process. SLAMon gathers performance data from the whole business process instead of separate tasks inside the process. The business process owner defines the business process test flow and the data gathered from the flow, so that the data can be aggregated to usable statistics.\r\n\r\nSLAMon can be used for example testing whether a cloud service's process time meets the service level agreement, or whether a given business process in a cloud works as it is defined to work.\r\n\r\n### The current features of SLAMon\r\n\r\nCurrently SLAMon provides the following features (2015-04-07)\r\n\r\n* [slamon-jbpm](https://github.com/SLAMon/slamon-jbpm) - JBoss Business Process Management Suite (jBPMS) WorkItemHandler implementation for sending tasks to AFM to be executed by Agents\r\n* [Agent Fleet Manager](https://github.com/SLAMon/slamon-agent-fleet-manager) (AFM) that receives tasks from Business Process Management Suite and gives received tasks to polling Agents\r\n* [Python Agent](https://github.com/SLAMon/slamon-python-agent) with SDK for task handler implementations\r\n* [Java Agent SDK](https://github.com/SLAMon/slamon-java-lib)\r\n* [Android Agent](https://github.com/SLAMon/slamon-android)\r\n* Push notifications for alerting about test process situation to the Android device using JBoss Unified Push","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
